  title: "My QA Journey",
  story: "I started as Level Support in a publishing company where I handled customer issues. While addressing customer complaints and issues, I began understanding and actually started identifying bugs in the products. My Tech Lead was surprised, and even the QA team members were happy and impressed. They suggested that I should actually plan and join a QA role.\n\nThen I got into this profile. Though I wasn't actually familiar with the role details, I was told that I have an eye for QA. I slowly learned about the QA role, and now this is my journey. This is what I am now.\n\nI don't have a technical degree, just working skills and a passion for quality."

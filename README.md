About Me
From customer support to quality assurance - a journey driven by curiosity and a natural eye for detail

My QA Journey
I started as Level Support in a publishing company where I handled customer issues. While addressing customer complaints and issues, I began understanding and actually started identifying bugs in the products. My Tech Lead was surprised, and even the QA team members were happy and impressed. They suggested that I should actually plan and join a QA role.

Then I got into this profile. Though I wasn't actually familiar with the role details, I was told that I have an eye for QA. I slowly learned about the QA role, and now this is my journey. This is what I am now.

I don't have a technical degree, just working skills and a passion for quality.

My QA Philosophy
I think as a user. When I'm using a product and find an issue, I experience how it feels to encounter problems. As a QA, I put myself in the user's shoes and think about how I feel when I find an issue as a user. I don't want any user to feel the same frustration I do when encountering problems.

Tennis Enthusiast
I idolize Rafael Nadal, then Federer and Djokovic. In the newer generation, I love Sasha Zverev, Sinner, and Alcaraz.

Future Aspirations
I'm interested in the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and want to grow myself so that I can teach others what the job of QA truly entails. My goal is to become a mentor and help others understand the importance of quality assurance.

Tech Explorer
Anything new in tech or data drives me into it. Money, politics, and market dynamics interest me greatly.
